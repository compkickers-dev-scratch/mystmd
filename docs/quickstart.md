---

These quickstart tutorials are to get you up and running on your local computer 👩‍💻:

- learn how to write MyST Markdown 🖊
- export PDF, Word and $\LaTeX$ documents 📑
- and create a website like this one 🌎

The current tutorial will help you get up and running from scratch.

:::{note} Goals and Prerequisites
**Goal**: The goal of this tutorial is to help you **install MyST** on your local computer 👩‍💻, create a local website 🌎, and edit elements of the theme to improve the website style 🎨.

**Skills**: It is helpful if you have some familiarity with using the command line, as well as using a text editor and/or JupyterLab.

**Tools**: You'll need a code and notebook editor ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is great, and we recommend [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) for notebooks) as well as access to a CLI.

## Install the MyST Markdown CLI 📦

`mystmd` is a {abbr}`CLI (Command Line Interface)` that provides modern tooling for technical writing, reproducible science, and creating scientific & technical websites.
These instructions help you install the CLI.

### Install `conda` and `conda-forge`

The easiest way to install MyST is with [the `mamba`/`conda` package manager](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
`mamba` is a multi-language manager that is useful for users across many data science languages like Python, R, Julia, and JavaScript.

The easiest way to install `mamba` is with [the `miniforge` distribution](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file).

🛠 Install [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge):

1. Go to [the `miniforge` Downloads section](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#download).
2. Download the release for your platform and follow the instructions.
3. To check that you've installed properly, you should be able to execute the following command to print the version of conda:

   ```shell
   $ mamba --version
   mamba 1.5.8
   conda 24.7.1   
   ```

:::{seealso} There are many ways to install MyST
This tutorial focuses on the simplest possible way to install MyST from scratch.
If you're familiar with either Python or JavaScript-based workflows, see [](installing.md) for more information on how to install MyST.
:::
### Install the `mystmd` package

Once `conda` has been installed, we can install the `mystmd` package from `conda-forge`:
```shell
conda install -c conda-forge mystmd
```

Once installed you should be able to print the version of MyST like so:

```shell
$ myst -v
v1.3.1
```

:::{seealso} Not using `conda-forge`?

MyST needs both NodeJS and NPM to build sites locally. By installing `mystmd` from conda-forge, we do not need to install NodeJS manually. 

See [](./install-node.md) for more information about installing a JavaScript environment.
:::

## Build your first MyST site

Next we'll download some sample content and use MyST to render it as a local web server!

### Download example content

We provide an example project that includes a few simple markdown files and some Jupyter Notebooks.
Through the course of the tutorials we will add content to these documents that show off some of the features of MyST.

🛠 Download the example content[^no-git], and navigate into the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd-quickstart.git
cd mystmd-quickstart
```

[^no-git]: If you aren't familiar with git, it isn't required for this tutorial, you can download the zip file with the contents from the [quickstart repository](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd-quickstart).

### Initialize MyST in the content folder 🚀

Next we will create a `myst.yml` configuration file that is required to render your project.

🛠 Run `myst`

The `myst` command is a shortcut for `myst init`, which has a few more options for writing specific parts of the configuration file and a table of contents for your site.

```shell
$ myst

Welcome to the MyST Markdown CLI!! 🎉 🚀

myst init walks you through creating a myst.yml file.

You can use myst to:

 - create interactive websites from markdown and Jupyter Notebooks 📈
 - build & export professional PDFs and Word documents 📄

Learn more about this CLI and MyST Markdown at: https://mystmd.org

💾 Writing new project and site config file: myst.yml
```

### Preview your MyST site locally

Preview a rendered version of the quickstart content to make sure that MyST is working properly.

🛠 When prompted, type `Yes` to install and serve your MyST content locally:

```bash
? Would you like to run "myst start" now? Yes
```

or manually serve the quickstart content with the following command:

```bash
myst start
```

Starting the server requires a theme, this will download the default `book-theme` from [the MyST themes](./website-templates.md).
This can take **up to a minute** the first time, and then will be cached in the `_build/templates` directory.

```text

📖 Built paper.md in 32 ms.
📖 Built README.md in 35 ms.
📚 Built 3 pages for myst in 82 ms.

  ✨✨✨  Starting Book Theme  ✨✨✨

⚡️ Compiled in 524ms.

🔌 Server started on port 3000!  🥳 🎉

  👉  http://localhost:3000  👈
```

🛠 Open your web browser to `http://localhost:3000`[^open-port]

[^open-port]: If port `3000` is in use on your machine, an open port will be used instead, follow the link provided in the terminal.

The example site in this tutorial only has three pages and by default the `01-paper.md` page is seen in [](#frontmatter-before), which has minimal styles applied to the content.

🎉 **Congratulations**, you just build your first MyST site!

## Configuration and structure

The final section of this tutorial takes a closer look at the files that we just created, and aspects of your MyST project can be customized.

### Folder Structure

If you are using a text editor, for example [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open up the folder to explore the files:

```text
quickstart/
  ├── 🆕 _build
  │   ├── exports
  │   ├── site
  │   │   ├── content
  │   │   ├── public
  │   │   └── config.json
  │   ├── temp
  │   └── templates
  │       ├── site/myst/book-theme
  │       └── tex/myst/arxiv_two_column
  ├── images
  │   ├── image.png
  │   └── image.gif
  ├── 01-paper.md
  ├── 02-notebook.ipynb
  ├── README.md
  └── 🆕 myst.yml
```

Running `myst init` added:

- `myst.yml` - the configuration file for your myst project and site
- `_build` - the folder containing the processed content and other `site` assets, which are used by the local web server.

The `_build` folder also contains your templates (including the site template you installed) and any exports you make (when we build a PDF the exported document will show up in the `_build/exports` folder). You can clean up the built files at any time using `myst clean`[^clean-all].

[^clean-all]:
    By default the `myst clean` command doesn't remove installed templates or cached web responses; however, the function can with a:\
    `myst clean --all`, or\
    `myst clean --templates --cache`.

    Before deleting any folders `myst` will confirm what is going to happen, or you can bypass this confirmation with the `-y` option. For example:

    ```text
    Deleting all the following paths:

      - _build/site
      - _build/templates

    ? Would you like to continue? Yes

    🗑 Deleting: _build/site
    🗑 Deleting: _build/templates
    ```

### Configure site and page options

If we open and look inside our `myst.yml` we will see a basic configuration like this:

```yaml
# See docs at: https://mystmd.org/guide/frontmatter
version: 1
project:
  # title:
  # description:
  keywords: []
  authors: []
  # github:
  # bibliography: []
site:
  template: book-theme
  # title:
  # options:
  #   logo: my_logo.png
  nav: []
  actions:
    - title: Learn More
      url: https://mystmd.org/guide
  domains: []
```

There are two important parts to the `myst.yml`:

`project:`
: The project holds metadata about the collection of files, such as authors, affiliations and licenses for all of the files, any of these values can optionally be overridden in a file. To see all of the options see [](./frontmatter.md), which includes which fields can be overridden by files in the project.

`site:`
: The site holds template information about the website, such as the logo, navigation, site actions and which template to use.

🛠 In `myst.yml`: Change the "`# title:`" comment in **site** to "`title: Fancy Title 🎩`" and save

Saving the `myst.yml` will have triggered a "full site rebuild"[^myst-start].
Take a look at the browser tab and you'll see that it has updated:

:::{figure} ./images/frontmatter-site-title.png
:width: 50%
:label: frontmatter-site-title

The site title will control site meta tags, and the browser-tab title, which is appended to each page title in the `book-theme`.
:::

[^myst-start]: If the server stopped, you can restart the server using `myst start`.

**See all Frontmatter options**

To see all of the options see [](./frontmatter.md), which includes which fields can be overridden by files in the project.

**Separating Project and Site Configurations**

% TODO: move this to a new quickstart that is specific about advanced config.
You may separate the `project` and `site` configurations into multiple `myst.yml` files to configure your website. Each website needs a single `site` configuration at the root level; then any subdirectory with content may have its own `project` configuration with project-specific frontmatter. For example, given a `content` directory with all your markdown and notebooks,you can create a `content/myst.yml` file with project frontmatter:

```yaml
version: 1
project:
  title: ...
  authors: ...
  ...
```

and a root-level `myst.yml` file that references the project in the `content` subfolder:

```yaml
version: 1
site:
  template: book-theme
  projects:
    - slug: my-content
      path: content
  ...
```

Doing this will keep the `_build` directory at the root level, but everything else outside of the `content` folder will be ignored. If you have a project in the same configuration file it can be accessed with `path: .`. Projects are "mounted" at the `slug:` (e.g. `/my-content/` above).
