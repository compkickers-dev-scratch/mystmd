title: Frontmatter
description: Frontmatter can be set at the top of your documents to change the look and feel of your articles.
thumbnail: thumbnails/frontmatter.png
---

Frontmatter allows you to specify metadata and options about how your project should behave or render.
Included in frontmatter are things like the document or project `title`, what `thumbnail` to use for site or content previews, `authors` that contributed to the work, and scientific identifiers like a `doi`.
Adding frontmatter ensures that these properties are available to downstream tools or build processes like building [](./creating-pdf-documents.md).

## Where to set frontmatter

Frontmatter can be set in a markdown (`md`) or notebook (`ipynb`) file (described as a “page” below) or in the `project:` section of a `myst.yml` file. When project frontmatter is set in a `myst.yml` file, those settings will be applied to all content in that project (apart from “page only” fields).

### In a MyST markdown file

A frontmatter section can be added at the top of any `md` file using `---` delimiters.

```yaml
---
title: My First Article
date: 2022-05-11
authors:
  - name: Mason Moniker
    affiliations:
      - University of Europe
---
```

### In a Jupyter Notebook

Frontmatter can be added to the first cell of a Jupyter Notebook, that cell should be a Markdown cell and use `---` delimiters as above.

:::{important} Install JupyterLab Myst
To have properly formatted frontmatter, you can install the `jupyterlab-myst` plugin for Jupyter. See the [quickstart tutorial](./quickstart-jupyter-lab-myst.md).

Without the extension installed, remember to format the contents of the section as valid `yaml` even though when rendered, the cell will not look well formatted in your notebook.
:::

:::{note} Using `jupytext` or a Markdown-based notebook?
:class: dropdown
If your Jupyter Notebook is described as a markdown file (e.g. using [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html), or [MyST](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/myst-notebooks.html)), then this should be included in the frontmatter section as usual in addition to the `jupyter` key that defines the kernel and jupytext metadata.
:::

### In a `myst.yml` file

Frontmatter fields can be added directly to any `project:` section within a `myst.yml` file. If your root `myst.yml` file only contains a `site:` section, and you want to add frontmatter, add a `project:` section at the top level and add the fields there. e.g.

```yaml
myst: v1
site: ...
project:
  license: CC-BY-4.0
  open_access: true
```

## Field Behavior

Frontmatter can be attached to a “page”, meaning a local `.md` or `.ipynb` or a “project”. However, individual frontmatter fields are not uniformly available at both levels, and behavior of certain fields are different between project and page levels. There are three field behaviors to be aware of:

`page & project`
: the field is available on both the page & project but they are independent

`page only`
: the field is only available on pages, and not present on projects and it will be ignored if set there.

`page can override project`
: the field is available on both page & project but the value of the field on the page will override any set of the project. Note that the page field must be omitted or undefined, for the project value to be used, value of `null` (or `[]` in the case of `authors`) will still override the project value but clear the field for that page.

+++

## Thumbnail & Banner

The thumbnail is used in previews for your site in applications like Twitter, Slack, or any other link preview service. This should, by convention, be included in a `thumbnails` folder next to your content. You can also explicitly set this field to any other image on your local file system or a remote URL to an image. This image will get copied over to your public folder and optimized when you build your project.

```yaml
thumbnail: thumbnails/myThumbnail.png
```

If you do not specify an image the first image in the content of a page will be selected. If you explicitly do not want an image, set `thumbnail` to `null`.

You can also set a banner image which will show up in certain themes, for example, the `article-theme`:

```yaml
banner: banner.png
```

:::{figure} ./images/article-theme.png
:name: banner-example
Example of a banner in a site using the `article-theme`.

## Affiliations

You can create an affiliation directly by adding it to an author, and it can be as simple as a single string.

```yaml
authors:
  - name: Marissa Myst
    affiliation: University of British Columbia
```

You can also add much more information to any affiliation, such as a ROR, ISNI, or an address. A very complete affiliations list for an author at the University of British Columbia is:

```yaml
authors:
  - name: Marissa Myst
    affiliations:
      - id: ubc
        institution: University of British Columbia
        ror: https://ror.org/03rmrcq20
        isni: 0000 0001 2288 9830
        department: Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences
        address: 2020 – 2207 Main Mall
        city: Vancouver
        region: British Columbia
        country: Canada
        postal_code: V6T 1Z4
        phone: 604 822 2449
  - name: Miles Mysterson
    affiliation: ubc
```

Notice how you can use an `id` to avoid writing this out for every coauthor. Additionally, if the affiliation is a single string and contains a semi-colon `;` it will be treated as a list. The affiliations can also be added to your `project` frontmatter in your `myst.yml` and used across any document in the project.

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} article.md

```yaml
---
title: My Article
authors:
  - name: Marissa Myst
    affiliation: ubc
  - name: Miles Mysterson
    affiliations: ubc; stanford
---
```

:::
:::{tab-item} myst.yml

```yaml

    department: Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences
    address: 2020 – 2207 Main Mall
    city: Vancouver
    region: British Columbia
    country: Canada
    postal_code: V6T 1Z4
    phone: 604 822 2449
  - id: stanford
    name: ...
```

:::

If you use a string that is not recognized as an already defined affiliation in the project or article frontmatter, an affiliation will be created automatically and normalized so that it can be referenced:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Written Frontmatter

```yaml
authors:

    If your research group has a name, you can use both `name` and `institution`,
    however, at least one of these is required.

````

## Date

The date field is a string and should conform to a valid Javascript data format. Examples of acceptable date formats are:

- `2021-12-14T10:43:51.777Z` - [an ISO 8601 calendar date extended format](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/#sec-date-time-string-format), or
- `14 Dec 2021`
- `14 December 2021`
- `2021, December 14`
- `2021 December 14`
- `12/14/2021` - `MM/DD/YYYY`
- `12-14-2021` - `MM-DD-YYYY`
- `2022/12/14` - `YYYY/MM/DD`
- `2022-12-14` - `YYYY-MM-DD`

Where the latter example in that list are valid [IETF timestamps](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822#page-14)

## Licenses

This field can be set to a string value directly or to a License object.

Available fields in the License object are `content` and `code` allowing licenses to be set separately for these two forms of content, as often different subsets of licenses are applicable to each. If you only wish to apply a single license to your page or project use the string form rather than an object.

String values for licenses should be a valid “Identifier” string from the [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/). Identifiers for well-known licenses are easily recognizable (e.g. `MIT` or `BSD`) and MyST will attempt to infer the specific identifier if an ambiguous license is specified (e.g. `GPL` will be interpreted as `GPL-3.0+` and a warning raised letting you know of this interpretation). Some common licenses are:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:name: table-common-licenses

* - Common Content Licenses
  - Common Code Licenses

* - - `CC-BY-4.0`
    - `CC-BY-SA-4.0`
    - `CC-BY-N-SA-4.0`
    - `CC0-1.0`

  - - `MIT`
    - `BSD`
    - `GPL-3.0+`
    - `Apache-2.0`
    - `LGPL-3.0-or-later`
    - `AGPL`
```

By using the correct SPDX Identifier, your website will automatically use the appropriate icon for the license and link to the license definition.

## Funding

Funding frontmatter is able to contain multiple funding and open access statements, as well as award info.

It may be as simple as a single funding statement:

```yaml
funding: This work was supported by University.
```

Funding may also specify award id, name, sources ([affiliation object or reference](#affiliations)), investigators ([contributor objects or references](#authors)), and recipients ([contributor objects or references](#authors)).

```yaml
authors:
  - id: auth0
    name: Jane Doe
funding:
  statement: This work was supported by University.
  id: award-id-000
  name: My Award
  sources:
    - name: University
  investigators:
    - name: John Doe
  recipients:
    - auth0
```

Multiple funding objects with multiple awards are also possible:

```yaml
authors:
  - id: auth0
    name: Jane Doe
funding:
  - statement: This work was supported by University.
    awards:
      - id: award-id-000
        name: My First Award
        sources:
          - name: University
        investigators:
          - name: John Doe
        recipients:
          - auth0
      - id: award-id-001
        name: My Second Award
        sources:
          - name: University
        investigators:
          - name: John Doe
        recipients:
          - auth0
  - statement: Open access was supported by Consortium.
    open_access: Users are allowed to reproduce without prior permission
    awards:
      - id: open-award-999
        sources:
          - name: Consortium
```

## Venue

The term `venue` is borrowed from the [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org/about-the-data/venue) API definition:

> Venues are where works are hosted.

Available fields in the `venue` object are `title` and `url`.

Some typical `venue` values may be:

```yaml
venue:
  title: Journal of Geophysics
  url: https://journal.geophysicsjournal.com
```

or

```yaml
venue:
  title: EuroSciPy 2022
  url: https://www.euroscipy.org/2022
```

## Biblio

The term `biblio` is borrowed from the [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org/about-the-data/venue) API definition:

> Old-timey bibliographic info for this work. This is mostly useful only in citation/reference contexts. These are all strings because sometimes you'll get fun values like "Spring" and "Inside cover."

Available fields in the `biblio` object are `volume`, `issue`, `first_page` and `last_page`.

Some example `biblio` values may be:

```yaml
biblio:
  volume: '42'
  issue: '3'
  first_page: '1' # can be a number or string
  last_page: '99' # can be a number or string
```

OR

```yaml
biblio:
  volume: '2022'
  issue: Winter
  first_page: Inside cover # can be a number or string
```
