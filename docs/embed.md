You can embed **labeled content** (paragraphs, figures, notebook outputs, etc) across pages, allowing you to avoid re-writing the same information twice.

::::{seealso} Creating a Label

Embedding content requires a label to be present.
To attach labels to blocks of content, see [](./cross-references.md).
To attach labels to Jupyter Notebook content, see [](./reuse-jupyter-outputs.md)

For the examples below, we are defining a figure with a label:

```markdown
:::{figure} https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x200?beach,ocean
:name: myLabel
Here's a cool figure.
:::
```

:::{figure} https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x200?beach,ocean
:name: myLabel
Here's a cool figure.
:::

## The `{embed}` directive

The {myst:directive}`embed` directive can be used like so:

````myst
```{embed} #myLabel
```
````

```{embed} #myLabel

```

Note that this works for any labeled item in your MyST document, including from other pages.
For example, the following references the admonitions list in [](admonitions.md).

````
```{embed} #admonitions-list
```
````

```{embed} #admonitions-list

```

## The `![](#embed)` short-hand

The embedding markdown shorthand lets you quickly embed content using the Markdown image syntax (see more about [images](./figures.md)).
It can be used like so:

```markdown
![](#myLabel)
```

![](#myLabel)

## Embed images into figures

If you have a labeled image in your documentation, you can embed it as a Figure so that it contains figure metadata (like a caption, or adding alt-text).
To do so, use a **label attached to an image** instead of a filepath.

For example, we'll define an image with a label below:

```
(nice-sunset)=
![](https://source.unsplash.com/random/500x150?sunset)
```

(nice-sunset)=
![](https://source.unsplash.com/random/500x150?sunset)

And embed it into a figure next with a new `label`:

````
```{figure} #nice-sunset
:label: sunset-figure
Here's a nice sunset with a caption!
```
````

```{figure} #nice-sunset
:label: sunset-figure
Here's a nice sunset with a caption!
```

The new label can be referred to in this context, i.e. `[@sunset-figure]`: [@sunset-figure], which refers to the new figure rather than the original image. This allows you to scroll to embedded content on the page, rather than jumping to the original document. Note that this is especially useful with [embedding Jupyter Notebook outputs](./reuse-jupyter-outputs.md). For example:

```{figure} #altair-horsepower
This figure has been included from a Jupyter Notebook and can be referred to in cross-references through a different label. See [](./reuse-jupyter-outputs.md) for more information.
```

## Embed notebook content and outputs

You can embed notebook content (for example, images generated by running a cell).
For instructions on how to embed notebook content, see [](./reuse-jupyter-outputs.md).

## `{embed}` vs. `{include}`

The {myst:directive}`include` directive is very similar to {myst:directive}`embed`, with a few key differences.

`{include}`
: parses source files (e.g. text files on your filesystem) and inserts them into the document structure as if you had written the content in your target source file.

`{embed}`
: Pulls any labelled MyST content or outputs already parsed in your project.
