description: Deploy your MyST site to static HTML or a MyST-aware server.
---

The default themes for MyST sites are applications that render structured data _dynamically_, and are not static HTML sites. This choice allows the websites to include many [performance enhancements](./accessibility-and-performance.md) such as pre-fetching for instant page-transitions, loading indicators, and smaller network payloads. However, these advantages require that your website either (a) requires a web server or service that understands MyST sites; or (b) is changed to an HTML export that does not include these features but does allow you to host static files on services like GitHub pages.

## Creating Static HTML

To create a static HTML export of your MyST site, build it as HTML:

```bash
myst build --html
```

After the build process, you can see the folder in `_build/html`, which has all assets for your static website. You can verify that the site is working correctly by starting a static web-server, for example,\
`npx serve _build/html`\
which will serve a static version of the site.

:::{danger} Static sites should have an `index.html`
:class: dropdown

Your site should be configured with a single project at the root, this can be done by removing the `site.projects` list so that the site builds at the root url, rather than in a nested folder.

If your project is configured to be in a nested folder using a project `slug`, a site index will _not_ be created and your project will be instead accessible at a nested slug.

To fix this, change your `site` configuration to use a flat rather than nested project:

```yaml
version: 1
# Your project must be listed in the same myst.yml configuration
project: ...
site:
  title: Site Title
  # Delete the following `site.projects` configuration:
  # projects:
  #   - slug: nested-folder
  #     path: .
```

:::{tip} Ignore the `_build` folder in Git
:class: dropdown

If you are using Git, add the `_build` folder to your `.gitignore` so that it is not tracked. This folder contains auto-generated assets that can easily be re-built -- for example in a Continuous Integration system like GitHub Actions.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages[^pages] allows you to host your project in a folder, which is your repositories name, for example:\
`https://owner.github.io/repository_name`\
To get setup with GitHub Pages, ensure that your repository is hosted in GitHub and you are in the root of the Git repository.

ðŸ›  In the root of your git repository run `myst init --gh-pages`

The command will ask you questions about which branch to deploy from (e.g. `main`) and the name of the GitHub Action (e.g. `deploy.yml`). It will then create a GitHub Action[^actions] that will run next time you push your code to the main branch you specified.

:::{figure} ./images/myst-init-gh-pages.png
:class: framed
The command `myst init --gh-pages` will guide you through deploying to GitHub Pages.

[^actions]: To learn more about GitHub Actions, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart). These are YAML files created in the `.github/workflows` folder in the root of your repository.
[^pages]: To learn more about GitHub Pages, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages)

Navigate to your repository settings, click on Pages and enable GitHub pages. When choosing the source, use `GitHub Actions`:

ðŸ›  Turn on GitHub Pages using **GitHub Actions** as the source.

To trigger action, push your code with the workflow to main.

:::{warning} Custom Domains
GitHub allow you to host your static content on a custom domain, doing so _may_ require you to change the `BASE_URL` environment variable in the action. If you have unstyled content, try changing the `BASE_URL` to a blank string: `BASE_URL=''` (note the **single quotes**!); this serves the build assets from the root of your domain, rather than the default, which is the name or your repository.
:::

:::{tip} `BASE_URL` environment variable
:class: dropdown
The build and site assets are in the `/build` folder, which would point outside of the current repository to a repository called 'build', which probably doesn't exist!

To fix this, we can change the base url that the site is mounted to, which can be done through the `BASE_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export BASE_URL="/repository_name"
```

The base URL is _absolute_ and should not end with a trailing slash. This can be done automatically in a GitHub Action by looking to the `github.event.repository.name` variable.
:::

:::{note} Full GitHub Action
:class: dropdown

The GitHub Action to build and deploy your site automatically is:

```{code} yaml
:filename: deploy.yml
# This file was created automatically with `myst init --gh-pages` ðŸª„ ðŸ’š

name: MyST GitHub Pages Deploy
on:
  push:
    # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
    branches: [main]
env:
  # `BASE_URL` determines the website is served from, including CSS & JS assets
  # You may need to change this to `BASE_URL: ''`
  BASE_URL: /${{ github.event.repository.name }}

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: 'pages'
  cancel-in-progress: false
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

      - name: Install MyST Markdown
        run: npm install -g mystmd
      - name: Build HTML Assets
        run: myst build --html
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1

```

## Deploying to Curvenote

Curvenote provides a free service to host your MyST sites with an up-to-date theme ([deployment documentation](https://github.com/curvenote/action-myst-publish) for MyST sites). The websites are hosted on a `curve.space` subdomain with your username or a [custom domain](https://curvenote.com/docs/web/custom-domains). To configure the domain(s) add them to your site configuration:

```yaml
site:
  domains:
    - username.curve.space
```

You can then deploy the site using:

```bash
curvenote deploy
```

You can also deploy from a GitHub action, which will build your site and then deploy it to Curvenote.

ðŸ›  In the root of your git repository run `myst init --gh-curvenote`

The command will ask you questions about which branch to deploy from (e.g. `main`) and the name of the GitHub Action (e.g. `deploy.yml`). It will then create a GitHub Action[^actions] that will run next time you push your code to the main branch you specified. Ensure that you including setting up your `CURVENOTE_TOKEN` which can be created from your Curvenote profile.

:::{tip} Full GitHub Actions
:class: dropdown

You can use GitHub actions to build and deploy your site automatically when you merge new documents, for example.

See the documentation for the action, including setting up your `CURVENOTE_TOKEN`:\
https://github.com/curvenote/action-myst-publish

```yaml
name: deploy-myst-site
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy ðŸš€
        uses: curvenote/action-myst-publish@v1
        env:
          CURVENOTE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CURVENOTE_TOKEN }}
```
