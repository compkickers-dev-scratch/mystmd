title: Deploying to GitHub Pages
short_title: Github Pages
description: Deploy your MyST site to GitHub pages with a single command.
---

GitHub Pages[^pages] allows you to host your project in a folder, which is your repositories name, for example:\
`https://owner.github.io/repository_name`\
To get setup with GitHub Pages, ensure that your repository is hosted in GitHub and you are in the root of the Git repository.

ðŸ›  In the root of your git repository run `myst init --gh-pages`

The command will ask you questions about which branch to deploy from (e.g. `main`) and the name of the GitHub Action (e.g. `deploy.yml`). It will then create a GitHub Action[^actions] that will run next time you push your code to the main branch you specified.

The command `myst init --gh-pages` will guide you through deploying to GitHub Pages.

[^actions]: To learn more about GitHub Actions, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart). These are YAML files created in the `.github/workflows` folder in the root of your repository.
[^pages]: To learn more about GitHub Pages, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages)

Navigate to your repository settings, click on Pages and enable GitHub pages. When choosing the source, use `GitHub Actions`:

ðŸ›  Turn on GitHub Pages using **GitHub Actions** as the source.

To trigger action, push your code with the workflow to main.

:::{tip} You will probably need to set a `BASE_URL`
GitHub Pages likely requires you to set a `BASE_URL` because the URL for GitHub Pages defaults to a sub-folder of `username.github.io` (e.g. `username.github.io/myrepository/`).
The easieset thing to do is use the GitHub Action variable for the repository name:

```yaml
BASE_URL: /${{ github.event.repository.name }}
```

If you're using a custom domain (e.g. `mydomain.org`) then you may need to manually set `BASE_URL` to an empty string, like `export BASE_URL=''`.

See [](#deploy:base-url) for more information.

:::{note} Example: Full GitHub Action
:class: dropdown

The GitHub Action to build and deploy your site automatically is:

```{code} yaml
:filename: deploy.yml
# This file was created automatically with `myst init --gh-pages` ðŸª„ ðŸ’š

name: MyST GitHub Pages Deploy
on:
  push:
    # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
    branches: [main]
env:
  # `BASE_URL` determines the website is served from, including CSS & JS assets
  # You may need to change this to `BASE_URL: ''`
  BASE_URL: /${{ github.event.repository.name }}

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: 'pages'
  cancel-in-progress: false
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18.x
      - name: Install MyST Markdown
        run: npm install -g mystmd
      - name: Build HTML Assets
        run: myst build --html
