description: Deploy your MyST site to GitHub pages with a single command.

GitHub Pages[^pages] allows you to host your project in a folder, which is your repositories name, for example:\
`https://owner.github.io/repository_name`\
To get setup with GitHub Pages, ensure that your repository is hosted in GitHub and you are in the root of the Git repository.

ðŸ›  In the root of your git repository run `myst init --gh-pages`

The command will ask you questions about which branch to deploy from (e.g. `main`) and the name of the GitHub Action (e.g. `deploy.yml`). It will then create a GitHub Action[^actions] that will run next time you push your code to the main branch you specified.

The command `myst init --gh-pages` will guide you through deploying to GitHub Pages.

[^actions]: To learn more about GitHub Actions, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart). These are YAML files created in the `.github/workflows` folder in the root of your repository.
[^pages]: To learn more about GitHub Pages, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages)

Navigate to your repository settings, click on Pages and enable GitHub pages. When choosing the source, use `GitHub Actions`:

ðŸ›  Turn on GitHub Pages using **GitHub Actions** as the source.

To trigger action, push your code with the workflow to main.

:::{warning} Custom Domains
GitHub allow you to host your static content on a custom domain, doing so _may_ require you to change the `BASE_URL` environment variable in the action. If you have unstyled content, try changing the `BASE_URL` to a blank string: `BASE_URL=''` (note the **single quotes**!); this serves the build assets from the root of your domain, rather than the default, which is the name or your repository.
:::

:::{tip} `BASE_URL` environment variable
:class: dropdown
The build and site assets are in the `/build` folder, which would point outside of the current repository to a repository called 'build', which probably doesn't exist!

To fix this, we can change the base url that the site is mounted to, which can be done through the `BASE_URL` environment variable:

```bash
export BASE_URL="/repository_name"
```

The base URL is _absolute_ and should not end with a trailing slash. This can be done automatically in a GitHub Action by looking to the `github.event.repository.name` variable.

:::{note} Full GitHub Action
:class: dropdown

The GitHub Action to build and deploy your site automatically is:

```{code} yaml
:filename: deploy.yml
# This file was created automatically with `myst init --gh-pages` ðŸª„ ðŸ’š

name: MyST GitHub Pages Deploy
on:
  push:
    # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
    branches: [main]
env:
  # `BASE_URL` determines the website is served from, including CSS & JS assets
  # You may need to change this to `BASE_URL: ''`
  BASE_URL: /${{ github.event.repository.name }}
