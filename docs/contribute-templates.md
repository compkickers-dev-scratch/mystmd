title: Contribute a LaTeX, Word or Typst Template
short_title: Create a Template
description: Create a MyST Template so others in the MyST community can make use of your work and potentially improve it. There is an API to list all templates, and when you contribute it, your template will show up in command line queries, like listing all `myst templates`.

The [MyST templates organization](https://github.com/myst-templates) curates a community collection of MyST Markdown compatible templates. These templates allow MyST to export markdown files as typeset, formatted documents using PDF, LaTeX, Word or Typst templates. These templates expose data-driven options for customization ensuring the final documents comply with author submission guidelines provided by a particular journal, conference organizer or university.

## Creating a Template

To create a template, you can [follow the guide](https://mystmd.org/jtex/create-a-latex-template), as well as see the video below. Note that these guides are currently written for LaTeX, but can be generalized for Word and Typst. Documentation updates welcome!
