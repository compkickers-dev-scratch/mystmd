subtitle: Install the MyST CLI using your favourite package manager
short_title: Install MyST
description: MyST Markdown is available through Node and npm, install the package with `npm install mystmd`.
---

:::{tip}
The MyST Markdown Command Line Interface (CLI) is available through [NodeJS](./install-node.md) and the node package manager, `npm`. NodeJS is used by [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) (as well as many other Python packages) so you may already have it installed, and the following command may just work ðŸ¤ž:

```shell
npm install -g mystmd
```
:::

To install the MyST CLI, choose your preferred package manager. If you do not know what a package manager is, *it is recommended that you install MyST with `mamba` from conda-forge*.

ðŸ›  Install `mamba` (<https://mamba.readthedocs.io>), see <xref:biapol#ref:miniforge_python>.


```shell
$ mamba --version
mamba 1.5.8
conda 24.7.1   
```

ðŸ›  Install `mystmd` from `conda-forge`:

```shell
mamba install -c conda-forge mystmd
```

ðŸ›  Install `node` (<https://nodejs.org>), see [Installing NodeJS](./install-node.md):

```shell
$ node -v
v20.4.0
```

ðŸ›  Then install `mystmd`:

```shell
pip install mystmd
```

::::
::::{tab-item} NPM

ðŸ›  Install `node` (<https://nodejs.org>), see [Installing NodeJS](./install-node.md)

```shell
$ node -v
v20.4.0
```

ðŸ›  Then install `mystmd` using npm, yarn or pnpm:

```shell
npm install -g mystmd
```

::::
:::::

This will install `myst` globally (`-g`) on your system and add a link to the main CLI tool. To see if things worked, try checking the version with:

```shell
myst --version
```

This command should print the current version of the package. If all is good, you can type `myst` again in your terminal and it will list the help with all of the options available to you.

```{note}
If you have any challenges installing, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues).
