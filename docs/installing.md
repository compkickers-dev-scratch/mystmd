+++

The MyST Markdown Command Line Interface (CLI) is available through [NodeJS](./installing-prerequisites.md) and the node package manager, `npm`. Node is used by Jupyter as well as many other Python packages so you may already have it installed on your _PATH_ and the following command may just work ü§û.

üõ†Ô∏è [Install NodeJS](./installing-prerequisites.md), either version 18, 20, or 22

```{important} Installing Node

If you do not have `node` installed you can look at our how to guide for [Installing NodeJS](./installing-prerequisites.md). If you have any challenges installing, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/executablebooks/mystmd/issues).
```

üõ†Ô∏è Choose either PyPI, Conda, Mamba or NPM and run the following command:

:::{embed} #installing-myst-tabs
:::

This will install `myst` globally (`-g`) on your system and add a link to the main CLI tool. To see if things worked, try checking the version with:

```shell
myst --version
```

This command should print the current version of the package. If all is good, you can type `myst` again in your terminal and it will list the help with all of the options available to you.

```{note}
If you have any challenges installing, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/executablebooks/mystmd/issues).
```

## Updating MyST

There are new releases of the MyST Markdown CLI every few weeks, to update to the latest version of `myst`, use:

```shell
npm update -g mystmd
```

Try the `myst --version` command before and after, with an update you should be on the most up to date version (see [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/mystmd) for the latest version!). If you are not, try `npm uninstall -g mystmd` or without the `-g` global flag, until `myst` is no longer available on your command line. Then try installing again!

### Dependencies for $\LaTeX$ and PDF

If you are exporting to $\LaTeX$ with an open-source template specified (see all [templates](https://github.com/myst-templates)) or if you are creating a PDF you will need to install a version of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get).

## Working with a Proxy Policy

MyST performs web requests to download templates, check DOIs, etc. If you are working on a network that enforces a strict proxy policy for internet access, you may specify a proxy configuration string with the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable, for example:

```shell
HTTPS_PROXY=http://168.63.76.32:3128 \
myst build
```
