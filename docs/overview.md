# What is the MyST stack?

This section provides a high-level overview of the main concepts and tools in the MyST ecosystem. See the [guiding principles of the MyST ecosystem](../guiding-principles.md) for some more high-level context.

## A brief overview of the MyST Stack

In a sentence, the {term}`MyST Document Engine` is a program that parses {term}`MyST Markdown` files and builds them into {term}`MyST AST` that conforms to the {term}`MyST Specification`. Here's a diagram showing how these all relate to one another:

An overview of some major parts of the MyST stack and how they relate to one another.
In the most common workflow, a text file written in MyST Markdown is parsed by the {term}`MyST Document Engine` which outputs {term}`MyST AST` that follows the {term}`MyST Specification` (usually a JSON file). This MyST AST can be rendered into many different kinds of outputs, most-commonly HTML or PDF. This usually done by the MyST Document Engine, but can be done by any application that understands how to parse and use the MyST Specification.

## Are there other MyST engines?

The [MyST Specification](https://mystmd.org/spec) and [MyST Markdown Syntax](https://mystmd.org/guide) was designed so that others could implement their own parsers, document engines, and renderers using MyST. Although there are presently no independent examples of a true {term}`MyST Document Engine`, the MyST Parser for Sphinx project fulfils a similar role in the Sphinx ecosystem.

The [MyST Parser for Sphinx](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) is an extension for [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org) that can parse MyST Markdown into Sphinx's internal document structure. It was created to allow users to parse MyST Markdown syntax into Sphinx for [V1 of Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org). It now exists as an independent extension for the Sphinx community, as Jupyter Book now uses the MyST Document Engine.

:::{note} MyST Parser for Sphinx Compatibility
As the MyST Parser for Sphinx does not support all of the same syntax defined in the MyST Guide, or output {term}`MyST AST`, it's not a true {term}`MyST Document Engine` as defined by this project. That's OK! Its goal is to be a useful tool for the Sphinx community that only leverages parts of the MyST ecosystem (the markdown flavor), which for many people is "good enough".

## How does Jupyter Book relate to MyST?

The MyST Markdown Syntax was originally created to allow [Jupyter Book V1](https://jupyterbook.org) to use the [Sphinx Document engine](https://sphinx-doc.org) with Markdown content, rather than the less well-known <wiki:ReStructuredText> language.

Over time, the Jupyter Book team decided that the most sustainable path forward was to maintain its own document engine, the [MyST Document Engine](https://mystmd.org/guide). This new MyST Document Engine was initially created by [Curvenote](https://curvenote.com) and then developed jointly with the [Executable Books Project](https://executablebooks.org) before being donated to the [Jupyter Book subproject](https://compass.jupyterbook.org). It serves as the engine behind Jupyter Book V2.

You can think of Jupyter Book as a _distribution of the MyST Document Engine_. In other words, Jupyter Book wraps the MyST Document Engine application, with out-of-the-box configuration that supports a multi-page community knowledge base or documentation site. MyST is created and maintained by the [Jupyter Book team](https://compass.jupyterbook.org).

Currently, Jupyter Book and the MyST Document Engine share much of the same functionality. Over time, we imagine that the MyST Document Engine will be a more flexible tool that makes fewer assumptions about the end use-case that it's being used for. Jupyter Book will then have "more opinions" above the base configuration of the MyST Document Engine. That said â€” we are still figuring this out! We aren't sure the exact relationship the two will have, and will revisit this as we learn more. See [next.jupyterbook.org](https://next.jupyterbook.org) for more information.

## How do MyST and Sphinx compare?

[Sphinx] is an open-source documentation system used in many software projects, especially in the Python ecosystem. It builds an internal representation of technical documents as a tree (see [docutils]) similar to the {term}`MyST AST`. Whilst Sphinx partially defines a specification of-sorts for this AST[^docutils], a {term}`MyST Document Engine` explicitly publishes its {term}`MyST AST` for other tools to consume.

The Sphinx ecosystem has excellent support for Python documentation, referencing content, as well as externally providing an inventory of references known as [intersphinx]. You can link to Sphinx documentation with a {term}`MyST Document Engine` by using [intersphinx references](#intersphinx), and the official {term}`MyST Document Engine` automatically exposes the information required to allow Sphinx documentation to reference your MyST project.

At this time, the offical {term}`MyST Document Engine` does not support the authoring of software API documentation[^api-docs]. As such, if your project is documenting Python software we suggest that you use Sphinx. If your project is primarily tutorials, educational textbooks (including with Jupyter Notebooks), a presentation, or scientific paper, we hope that you find a better fit with the MyST stack!

Sphinx and MyST take very different approaches to publishing to the web. In Sphinx, themes are used to customise the generation of HTML and JavaScript. Sites built using these themes can be deployed to static web servers like [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.com/). In the MyST world, the equivalent to a Sphinx theme is a {term}`MyST Renderer` that consumes the {term}`MyST AST` and outputs HTML and JavaScript for your browser. Formally separating the {term}`MyST Document Engine` that generates {term}`MyST AST` and the {term}`MyST Renderer` that consumes it makes it possible to create rich new experiences with MyST, such as the [SciPy Conference Proceedings](https://proceedings.scipy.org/) website that renders {term}`MyST AST` on the fly.

Although the official also supports static HTML outputs, implementing themes as applications means that it is easier to build more powerful and stateful customisations to the MyST viewing experience.
