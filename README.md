`mystmd` is a set of open-source, community-driven tools designed for scientific communication, including a powerful authoring framework that supports blogs, online books, scientific papers, reports and journals articles.

> **Note**
> The `mystmd` project is in **beta**. It is being used to explore a full MyST implementation and will change significantly and rapidly.
> The project is being developed by a small team of people on the Executable Books Project, and may make rapid decisions without fully public/inclusive discussion.
> We will continue to update this documentation as the project stabilizes.

## Overview

The `mystmd` project provides a command line tool (`mystmd`) for working with MyST Markdown projects.

- Provides functionality for cross-referencing, external structured links, and scientific citations
- Translate and render MyST Markdown into:
  - HTML for static websites, and modern React for interactive websites (like this website!)
  - PDFs and LaTeX documents, with specific templates for over 400 journals
  - Microsoft Word export
- Parse MyST into a standardized AST, that follows the MyST Markdown Spec

See the [documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide).

## Get Started

Ensure that you have an updated version of Node installed (<https://nodejs.org/>):

```bash
node -v
>> v20.4.0
```

The MyST Markdown CLI is available through NPM, PyPI and Conda:

```bash
# Using npm, yarn, or pnpm
npm install -g mystmd
# Or using PyPI
pip install mystmd
# Or using Conda / Mamba
conda install mystmd -c conda-forge
```

Usage:

```bash
myst init
myst start
myst build my-doc.md --tex
```

# Development

All packages for `mystmd` are included in this repository (a monorepo!).

## What's inside?

`mystmd` uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

**Command Line Tools:**

- `mystmd` this provides CLI functionality for `myst start`
- `mystmd-py` a python wrapper over `mystmd`, to ease install for the Python community. Not recommended for local development.

**Core Packages:**

- `myst-cli` this is the package that provides CLI functionality for `mystmd`, it does not export the CLI directly
- `jtex` a templating library ([see docs](https://mystmd.org/jtex))
- `myst-frontmater` definitions and validation for scientific authorship/affiliation frontmatter ([see docs](https://mystmd.org/guide/frontmatter))
- `myst-config` Validation and reading of configuration files
- `myst-templates` types and validation for templates (LaTeX, web and word)

**Markdown Parsing**

- `markdown-it-myst` markdown-it plugin to handle tokenizing roles and directives.
- `myst-directives` core directives for MyST
- `myst-roles` core roles for MyST
- `myst-parser` converts markdown-it token stream to mdast

**Readers**

- `tex-to-myst` convert LaTeX to MyST AST
- `jats-to-myst` convert JATS xml to MyST AST

**Transformers**

- `myst-transforms` a number of transformations for use with myst AST to transform, e.g. links, citations, cross-references, admonitions

**Export Tools**

- `myst-to-docx` convert MyST documents to word docs!
- `myst-to-jats` convert MyST to JATS, for use in scientific archives
- `myst-to-tex` convert MyST to LaTeX, to be used in combination with jtex to create stand alone LaTeX documents
- `myst-to-html` convert MyST to HTML

**Extensions:**

- `myst-ext-card`: Card directives
- `myst-ext-grid`: Grid directives
- `myst-ext-tabs`: Tab directives
- `myst-ext-reactive`: Reactive directives

**Utilities**

- `myst-common` Some common utilities for working with ASTs
- `myst-spec-ext` Extensions to `myst-spec` used throughout this repository, before pushing upstream
- `citation-js-utils` utility functions to deal with citations
- `myst-cli-utils` some shared utils between jtex, and myst-cli
- `simple-validators` validation utilities, that print all sorts of nice warnings

Each package is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).

### Versioning & Publishing

`mystmd` uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to document changes to this monorepo, call `npm run changeset` and follow the prompts. Later, `npm run version` will be called and then `npm run publish`.

### Utilities

`mystmd` is built and developed using:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd mystmd
npm run build
```

## Developing

The `mystmd` libraries and command line tools are written in TypeScript, and require [NodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org) for local development. The `mystmd-py` package, which is a thin Python wrapper around the `mystmd` bundle, can be installed by users using `pip` or `conda`. If you have already installed `mystmd` (e.g. via `pip` or `conda`), it is recommended that you uninstall it (or deactivate the relevant environment) before using the local development instructions below.

For local development, [clone the repository](https://github.com/executablebooks/mystmd) and install the dependencies using npm. You can then build the libraries (`npm run build`) and then optionally link to your globally installed `mystmd` in node using the `npm run link` command.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:executablebooks/mystmd.git
cd mystmd
npm install
npm run build
npm run link
```

These commands allow you to use the `myst` CLI in any directory as usual, and updates to the build are picked up when you rebuild. After making changes, you must rebuild the packages (via `npm run build` in the top-level directory), which is done efficiently depending on how deep your change is in the dependency tree. After the build is complete, you can reuse the myst client.

Tests are also a helpful development tool, which don't require full rebuilding. You can run the entire test suite using `npm run test`. If you are working in a particular package, change your working directory and run the tests there, to run in watch mode use `npm run test:watch`.

When contributing code, the continuous integration will run linting and formatting. You can run `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:format` locally to ensure they will pass. If you are using the VSCode editor, it can be setup to show you changes in real time and fix formatting issues on save (extensions: [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)).

We use `changesets` for tracking changes to packages and updating versions, please add a changeset using `npm run changeset`, which will ask you questions about the package and ask for a brief description of the change. Commit the changeset file to the repository as a part of your pull request.

Running in live-changes mode: depending on the package you are working in we have also setup live changes which can be faster than the `npm run build`; this can be run using `npm run dev`. If your changes aren't showing up, use `npm run build` as normal.

As of v1.0.0 this package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
